This tool decides whether or not to fire an anti-ballistic missile in a simulated environment.


## Description
The programme takes input in the form of hypothetical radar data and generates a boolean signal that determines if a simulated anti-ballistic missle is to be fired. This is decided by the function DECIDE() which takes all the radar data and determines which combinations of several possible "Launch Interceptor Conditions" (LIC) are relevant to the recieved radar data. 

There are 15 LIC's and DECIDE() evaluates them all and assignes the 15 corresponding boolean values to a "Conditions Met Vector" (CMV). The "Locigal Connector Matrix" (LCM) defines which LIC's must be evaluated jointly. What conditions has been met (CMV) and how the conditions relate to each other (LCM), is combined and stored in the "Preliminary Unlocking Matrix" (PUM). 

The last step is to consider which LIC's accualy matter, which is done in the "Preliminary Unlocking Vector"(PUV). The elements in the PUV indicates how to combine elements in the PUM to form the "Final Unlocking Vector"(FUV), if all values of the FUV are true then we are clear to fire an anti-ballistic missle.
